# State Management with Zustand

## Purpose

Define requirements for state management patterns using Zustand to ensure performance, prevent infinite loops, and maintain predictable state updates.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Store Structure

The system SHALL implement Zustand store with proper separation of state, actions, and selectors.

#### Scenario: State organization

- WHEN store is designed
- THEN state is organized by feature domains
- AND related state is grouped together
- AND state shape is flat and normalized
- AND state updates are immutable

#### Scenario: Action organization

- WHEN actions are defined
- THEN actions are grouped by functionality
- AND async actions handle loading states
- AND error handling is consistent
- AND actions are pure functions

#### Scenario: Selector organization

- WHEN selectors are created
- THEN selectors are exported as named exports
- AND individual selectors return primitive values
- AND computed selectors are memoized
- AND selectors have stable references

### Requirement: Performance Optimization

The system SHALL implement performance patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops.

#### Scenario: Primitive value selectors

- WHEN accessing simple state values
- THEN individual selectors return primitive values
- AND object selectors are avoided in components
- AND selector references remain stable
- AND components only re-render when values change

#### Scenario: Stable action references

- WHEN accessing store actions
- THEN action selectors use getState() for references
- AND action functions are not recreated
- AND useCallback is used with action references
- AND effect dependencies are properly managed

#### Scenario: Memoized computed values

- WHEN deriving state from multiple values
- THEN computed selectors use memoization
- AND expensive calculations are cached
- AND dependency arrays are minimal
- AND stale values are invalidated properly

### Requirement: Infinite Loop Prevention

The system SHALL implement patterns to prevent infinite update loops in React components.

#### Scenario: Selector stability

- WHEN using useSyncExternalStore
- THEN getSnapshot returns cached values
- AND object references are stable
- AND new objects are not created on each call
- AND React can properly detect changes

#### Scenario: Effect dependency management

- WHEN using useEffect with store values
- THEN stable selectors are used in dependencies
- AND action references are excluded from deps
- AND effect cleanup is implemented
- AND infinite effect loops are prevented

#### Scenario: Component render optimization

- WHEN components consume store state
- THEN only necessary state is subscribed to
- AND render frequency is minimized
- AND prop drilling is avoided
- AND component boundaries are respected

### Requirement: Async State Management

The system SHALL handle asynchronous state updates properly with loading and error states.

#### Scenario: Loading state management

- WHEN async operations are in progress
- THEN loading flags are set appropriately
- AND loading states are boolean and specific
- AND multiple operations can load simultaneously
- AND UI can show loading indicators

#### Scenario: Error state management

- WHEN async operations fail
- THEN error states are captured and stored
- AND error information is detailed and helpful
- AND error states can be cleared
- AND UI can display error messages

#### Scenario: Optimistic updates

- WHEN user actions are performed
- THEN optimistic updates are applied immediately
- AND rollback is implemented on failure
- AND user experience remains responsive
- AND server state is eventually consistent

### Requirement: State Persistence

The system SHALL support state persistence and recovery where appropriate.

#### Scenario: Local state persistence

- WHEN user preferences are changed
- THEN preferences are saved to localStorage
- AND preferences are loaded on app start
- AND persistence is error-handled
- AND preferences can be reset

#### Scenario: Session state management

- WHEN user session is active
- THEN session state is maintained in memory
- AND session is cleared on logout
- AND session expiration is handled
- AND security is maintained

### Requirement: DevTools Integration

The system SHALL provide development tools for debugging state changes.

#### Scenario: State inspection

- WHEN developing in development mode
- THEN Redux DevTools can be used with Zustand
- AND state changes are logged and time-traveled
- AND action history is available
- AND state can be inspected at any point

#### Scenario: Performance monitoring

- WHEN performance issues occur
- THEN store updates can be profiled
- AND re-render causes can be identified
- AND selector performance can be measured
- AND optimization opportunities are highlighted

### Requirement: Type Safety

The system SHALL maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the store.

#### Scenario: State typing

- WHEN store state is defined
- THEN all state has proper TypeScript types
- AND nested state is typed correctly
- AND optional state is properly marked
- AND type inference works as expected

#### Scenario: Action typing

- WHEN actions are implemented
- THEN action parameters are typed
- AND action return values are typed
- AND async actions have proper promise types
- AND type errors are caught at compile time

#### Scenario: Selector typing

- WHEN selectors are created
- THEN selector return types are inferred
- AND selector parameters are typed
- AND computed selectors have proper types
- AND type safety is maintained throughout

### Requirement: Testing Support

The system SHALL support testing of state management logic.

#### Scenario: Unit testing

- WHEN testing store logic
- THEN store can be easily mocked
- AND actions can be tested in isolation
- AND selectors can be tested with mock state
- AND async operations can be tested with mocks

#### Scenario: Integration testing

- WHEN testing with components
- THEN store can be wrapped in test providers
- AND state changes can be asserted
- AND component behavior can be verified
- AND test utilities are provided

### Requirement: Scalability

The system SHALL support scaling state management as the application grows.

#### Scenario: Modular architecture

- WHEN application features expand
- THEN store can be split into modules
- AND modules can be combined as needed
- AND circular dependencies are avoided
- AND module boundaries are clear

#### Scenario: Performance at scale

- WHEN state size grows large
- THEN store performance remains acceptable
- AND memory usage is optimized
- AND unnecessary computations are avoided
- AND large datasets are handled efficiently

### Requirement: Authentication State Management

The application SHALL maintain consistent authentication state across all components and handle unauthorized API responses by redirecting users to the login page.

#### Scenario: API unauthorized response

- WHEN an API call returns 401 Unauthorized
- THEN the application SHALL dispatch auth:logout event
- THEN the application SHALL update auth state to unauthenticated
- THEN the application SHALL redirect to /login with current URL as redirect parameter

#### Scenario: Global logout event handling

- WHEN auth:logout event is dispatched globally
- THEN the application SHALL clear authentication state
- THEN the application SHALL remove stored tokens
- THEN the application SHALL redirect to login page
