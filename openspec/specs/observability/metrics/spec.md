# Observability: Metrics

## Purpose

Define requirements for collecting and exposing application metrics for monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Basic Process Metrics

The API SHALL expose basic process and runtime metrics via Prometheus endpoint.

#### Scenario: Process Metrics Available

- **WHEN** Prometheus scrapes the `/metrics` endpoint
- **THEN** basic process metrics SHALL be available including CPU, memory, and process information
- **AND** metrics SHALL follow Prometheus exposition format

### Requirement: Metrics Endpoint

The API SHALL provide a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.

#### Scenario: Metrics Endpoint Access

- **WHEN** Prometheus makes GET request to `/metrics`
- **THEN** endpoint SHALL return metrics in Prometheus text format
- **AND** response SHALL have Content-Type: `text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`

### Requirement: HTTP Request Metrics

The API SHALL expose comprehensive HTTP request metrics via Prometheus endpoint for observability and SLO monitoring.

#### Scenario: HTTP Request Duration Tracking

- **WHEN** HTTP requests are processed by the API
- **THEN** request duration SHALL be tracked in histogram buckets with labels for method, route, and status code
- **AND** metrics SHALL be available as `http_server_requests_duration_seconds_bucket` for Grafana latency panels

#### Scenario: HTTP Request Count Tracking

- **WHEN** HTTP requests are processed by the API
- **THEN** request counts SHALL be incremented with labels for method, route, and status code
- **AND** metrics SHALL be available as `http_server_requests_total` for Grafana rate panels

#### Scenario: Error Rate Calculation

- **WHEN** HTTP requests result in error status codes (4xx, 5xx)
- **THEN** error metrics SHALL be properly labeled with status codes
- **AND** Grafana SHALL be able to calculate error rates from `http_server_requests_total{status=~"4..|5.."}`

#### Scenario: Route-based Labeling

- **WHEN** requests are made to API endpoints
- **THEN** metrics SHALL use route template patterns (e.g., `/users/:id`) instead of raw paths
- **AND** cardinality explosion SHALL be prevented through proper path normalization

#### Scenario: Performance Overhead

- **WHEN** HTTP metrics collection is enabled
- **THEN** performance overhead SHALL be less than 1ms per request
- **AND** metrics collection SHALL not impact API response times significantly

### Requirement: Self-hosted Only Policy

All metrics collection SHALL remain within self-hosted infrastructure.

#### Scenario: No External Telemetry

- **WHEN** application is running in any environment
- **THEN** no metrics SHALL be sent to external third-party services
- **AND** all telemetry SHALL remain within local infrastructure boundaries
