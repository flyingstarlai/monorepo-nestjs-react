### Requirement: Metrics Endpoint
The API SHALL provide a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.

#### Scenario: Metrics Endpoint Access
- **WHEN** Prometheus makes GET request to `/metrics`
- **THEN** endpoint SHALL return metrics in Prometheus text format
- **AND** response SHALL have Content-Type: `text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`

### Requirement: Self-hosted Only Policy
All metrics collection SHALL remain within self-hosted infrastructure.

#### Scenario: No External Telemetry
