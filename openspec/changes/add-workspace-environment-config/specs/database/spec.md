## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Database Connection Support

The system SHALL support simultaneous connections to PostgreSQL for system data and MS SQL for workspace-specific data.

#### Scenario: Dual database configuration

- **WHEN** application starts
- **THEN** PostgreSQL connection is established for system database
- **AND** workspace-specific MS SQL connections can be created dynamically
- **AND** connection configurations are managed separately
- **AND** both database types are properly initialized

#### Scenario: Connection isolation

- **WHEN** accessing workspace data
- **THEN** workspace MS SQL connection is used for workspace-specific queries
- **AND** PostgreSQL connection is used for system metadata
- **AND** connection contexts are properly isolated
- **AND** cross-database transactions are handled appropriately

### Requirement: Dynamic Connection Management

The system SHALL support dynamic creation and management of workspace database connections.

#### Scenario: Connection creation

- **WHEN** a workspace requires database access
- **THEN** connection is created using environment configuration
- **AND** connection parameters are validated before creation
- **AND** connection pooling is configured appropriately
- **AND** connection is cached for subsequent use

#### Scenario: Connection caching

- **WHEN** multiple requests access the same workspace database
- **THEN** existing connection is reused from cache
- **AND** connection health is verified before reuse
- **AND** cache size limits are enforced
- **AND** idle connections are cleaned up periodically

#### Scenario: Connection failure handling

- **WHEN** a workspace database connection fails
- **THEN** appropriate error is returned to caller
- **AND** connection is marked as unhealthy
- **AND** reconnection attempts are made with exponential backoff
- **AND** cached connection is removed after persistent failures

### Requirement: Environment-Specific Migrations

The system SHALL support database migrations for workspace-specific MS SQL databases.

#### Scenario: Workspace database schema

- **WHEN** a new workspace environment is configured
- **THEN** base schema is applied to the MS SQL database
- **AND** migration history is tracked per workspace
- **AND** schema version is validated on connection
- **AND** migration failures are properly reported

#### Scenario: Schema updates

- **WHEN** workspace database schema needs updates
- **THEN** migrations can be applied to specific workspace databases
- **AND** migration order is preserved across workspaces
- **AND** rollback capabilities are maintained
- **AND** migration status is tracked and reported

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Database Configuration

Database configuration SHALL support both PostgreSQL and MS SQL connections with appropriate defaults and validation.

#### Scenario: Multi-database type support

- **WHEN** configuring database connections
- **THEN** PostgreSQL configuration is used for system database
- **AND** MS SQL configuration is used for workspace databases
- **AND** appropriate drivers and connection options are applied
- **AND** database-specific optimizations are configured

#### Scenario: Connection validation

- **WHEN** database connections are established
- **THEN** connection parameters are validated for each database type
- **AND** database-specific error handling is applied
- **AND** connection timeouts are appropriately configured
- **AND** SSL/TLS settings are applied when required
