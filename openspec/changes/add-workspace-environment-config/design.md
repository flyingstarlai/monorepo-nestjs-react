## Context

Workspaces currently share a single database connection. The requirement is to enable each workspace to have its own MS SQL database connection while maintaining the existing PostgreSQL-based system database for workspace metadata, users, and authentication.

## Goals / Non-Goals

- Goals: Enable per-workspace MS SQL database connections, maintain role-based access control, provide connection testing, support connection pooling for performance
- Non-Goals: Support for database types other than MS SQL, automatic database provisioning, database schema management for workspace databases

## Decisions

- Decision: Use cached connections per workspace (Option B) for optimal balance of performance and resource management
- Rationale: Avoids connection overhead of Option A while preventing resource exhaustion of Option C. Suitable for expected workspace count and usage patterns.
- Decision: Store Environment entity in main PostgreSQL database alongside workspace metadata
- Rationale: Maintains single source of truth for workspace configuration, leverages existing authentication and authorization infrastructure
- Decision: Implement connection testing on save only, not on input
- Rationale: Reduces database load, provides immediate feedback on configuration changes, follows user requirement specification

## Database Connection Architecture

**Recommended Approach: Cached Connections per Workspace**

```typescript
class WorkspaceConnectionManager {
  private connections = new Map<string, DataSource>();

  async getConnection(workspaceId: string): Promise<DataSource> {
    // Return cached connection or create new one
    // Implement connection health checks
    // Handle connection failures gracefully
  }
}
```

**Pros:**

- Balanced performance (reuses connections)
- Resource efficient (limits total connections)
- Fast subsequent access
- Connection health monitoring possible

**Cons:**

- Memory overhead for cached connections
- Requires connection lifecycle management
- More complex than dynamic connections

**Rejected Alternatives:**

- Option A (Dynamic): Too much overhead for frequent access
- Option C (Pooling): Overkill for current scale, complex to manage

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Risk**: Connection memory usage grows with workspace count
  - **Mitigation**: Implement connection limits and idle timeout cleanup
- **Risk**: Connection failures affect workspace functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation, retry logic, proper error messages
- **Trade-off**: Plain text credentials vs security
  - **Current**: Plain text as requested
  - **Future**: Encryption at rest, credential management system
- **Trade-off**: MS SQL only vs multi-database support
  - **Current**: MS SQL only as specified
  - **Future**: Extensible design for additional database types

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Create Environment entity and migration
2. **Phase 2**: Implement backend services and API endpoints
3. **Phase 3**: Add connection management infrastructure
4. **Phase 4**: Update frontend with environment configuration UI
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and validation
6. **Phase 6**: Documentation and deployment

**Rollback Procedures:**

- Database migration can be reverted if no environments are configured
- API changes are backward compatible
- Frontend changes are additive to existing settings

## Open Questions

- Connection pool size per workspace (default: 5-10 connections)
- Idle connection timeout duration (default: 30 minutes)
- Maximum number of cached connections system-wide
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds for connection failures
- Backup strategy for workspace database credentials
