## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Workspace Environment Configuration

Each workspace SHALL have its own MS SQL database environment configuration that can be managed by workspace Owners and Admins.

#### Scenario: Create environment configuration

- WHEN a workspace Owner or Admin accesses Advanced Settings
- AND provides valid MS SQL connection parameters
- THEN environment configuration is created for the workspace
- AND connection is tested before saving
- AND success message is displayed to user

#### Scenario: Update environment configuration

- WHEN a workspace Owner or Admin modifies existing environment configuration
- AND provides valid MS SQL connection parameters
- THEN environment configuration is updated for the workspace
- AND connection is tested before saving
- AND cached connections are refreshed
- AND success message is displayed to user

#### Scenario: View environment configuration

- WHEN a workspace member accesses Advanced Settings
- THEN current environment configuration is displayed
- AND connection status is shown
- AND edit controls are only visible to Owners and Admins

#### Scenario: Test database connection

- WHEN a user clicks "Test Connection" button
- THEN system attempts to connect using provided parameters
- AND connection result (success/failure) is displayed
- AND error details are shown for failed connections
- AND configuration is not saved unless explicitly requested

### Requirement: Environment Access Control

Environment configuration SHALL be restricted to workspace Owners and Admins only.

#### Scenario: Role-based access enforcement

- WHEN a workspace Member attempts to access environment configuration
- THEN edit controls are disabled
- AND read-only view of current configuration is shown
- AND appropriate messaging indicates restricted access

#### Scenario: Unauthorized API access prevention

- WHEN a non-Owner/Admin attempts to modify environment via API
- THEN request is rejected with 403 Forbidden status
- AND error message indicates insufficient permissions

### Requirement: MS SQL Connection Management

The system SHALL support MS SQL database connections with proper validation and error handling.

#### Scenario: Connection parameter validation

- WHEN environment configuration is submitted
- THEN all required MS SQL parameters are validated
- AND host, port, username, password, and database name are required
- AND optional parameters (connection timeout, encrypt) have defaults
- AND validation errors are displayed with specific field indicators

#### Scenario: Connection health monitoring

- WHEN workspace database connection is used
- THEN connection health is periodically checked
- AND failed connections trigger reconnection attempts
- AND persistent failures are logged and reported
- AND cached connections are refreshed on configuration changes

#### Scenario: Connection pooling and caching

- WHEN multiple requests access the same workspace database
- THEN connections are reused from cache
- AND connection pool limits are enforced
- AND idle connections are properly closed
- AND connection failures are handled gracefully

### Requirement: Environment Data Model

The system SHALL store environment configuration with proper data relationships and constraints.

#### Scenario: One-to-one workspace relationship

- WHEN environment configuration is created
- THEN it is uniquely associated with a single workspace
- AND only one environment configuration exists per workspace
- AND database constraints prevent duplicate environments

#### Scenario: Credential storage

- WHEN environment configuration is saved
- THEN database credentials are stored in plain text
- AND all connection parameters are persisted
- AND sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users

#### Scenario: Environment lifecycle

- WHEN a workspace is deleted
- THEN associated environment configuration is also deleted
- AND cached connections are properly closed
- AND database constraints ensure referential integrity

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Workspace Settings

Workspace settings SHALL include environment configuration in the Advanced Settings section.

#### Scenario: Advanced Settings integration

- WHEN a user accesses workspace settings
- THEN Advanced Settings section includes environment configuration
- AND environment form is integrated with existing settings layout
- AND consistent styling and navigation are maintained

#### Scenario: Settings navigation

- WHEN navigating between workspace settings sections
- THEN environment configuration is accessible via Advanced Settings
- AND breadcrumb navigation includes current section
- AND settings state is preserved during navigation
