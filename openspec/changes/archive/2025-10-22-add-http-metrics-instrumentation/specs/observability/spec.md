## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: HTTP Request Metrics
The API SHALL expose comprehensive HTTP request metrics via Prometheus endpoint for observability and SLO monitoring.

#### Scenario: HTTP Request Duration Tracking
- **WHEN** HTTP requests are processed by the API
- **THEN** request duration SHALL be tracked in histogram buckets with labels for method, route, and status code
- **AND** metrics SHALL be available as `http_server_requests_duration_seconds_bucket` for Grafana latency panels

#### Scenario: HTTP Request Count Tracking
- **WHEN** HTTP requests are processed by the API
- **THEN** request counts SHALL be incremented with labels for method, route, and status code
- **AND** metrics SHALL be available as `http_server_requests_total` for Grafana rate panels

#### Scenario: Error Rate Calculation
- **WHEN** HTTP requests result in error status codes (4xx, 5xx)
- **THEN** error metrics SHALL be properly labeled with status codes
- **AND** Grafana SHALL be able to calculate error rates from `http_server_requests_total{status=~"4..|5.."}`

#### Scenario: Route-based Labeling
- **WHEN** requests are made to API endpoints
- **THEN** metrics SHALL use route template patterns (e.g., `/users/:id`) instead of raw paths
- **AND** cardinality explosion SHALL be prevented through proper path normalization

#### Scenario: Performance Overhead
- **WHEN** HTTP metrics collection is enabled
- **THEN** performance overhead SHALL be less than 1ms per request
- **AND** metrics collection SHALL not impact API response times significantly
