## Context

Adding a comprehensive SQL Editor module to enable teams to manage MSSQL stored procedures through a web interface while maintaining the existing PostgreSQL-based application data. The system needs to support template-based procedure creation, version control, and workspace-based permissions.

## Goals / Non-Goals

- Goals:
  - Template-based stored procedure creation with consistent parameters
  - File tree explorer interface for intuitive navigation
  - Version control with diff capabilities for procedures
  - Workspace-based permission system (Owner/Author write, User execute)
  - MSSQL execution while keeping PostgreSQL for app data
  - Admin-only template and category management

- Non-Goals:
  - User-created templates (admin only)
  - Template versioning (procedures only)
  - Direct database schema management
  - Support for other database types beyond MSSQL for procedures

## Decisions

- Decision: Use separate MSSQL connection pool for stored procedure execution
  - Rationale: Keeps application data separate from procedure execution, allows independent scaling
  - Alternatives considered: Single connection with multiple databases, but adds complexity

- Decision: Implement version control at procedure level, not template level
  - Rationale: Templates are for consistency, procedures are for business logic
  - Alternatives considered: Versioning both, but adds unnecessary complexity for templates

- Decision: File tree explorer pattern similar to VSCode
  - Rationale: Familiar interface for developers, good for hierarchical organization
  - Alternatives considered: Table view, but less intuitive for folder-like structure

- Decision: Use Monaco Editor for SQL editing
  - Rationale: Industry standard, excellent SQL syntax highlighting, built-in features
  - Alternatives considered: CodeMirror, but Monaco has better SQL support

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Risk: MSSQL connection complexity in PostgreSQL-based app
  - Mitigation: Separate connection pools, proper error handling, connection testing

- Risk: SQL injection through procedure execution
  - Mitigation: Parameterized queries, role-based execution, audit logging

- Trade-off: Additional infrastructure complexity for dual database support
  - Benefit: Clear separation of concerns, independent scaling

- Trade-off: Learning curve for non-technical users
  - Benefit: Powerful capabilities for technical teams, templates reduce complexity

## Migration Plan

1. Phase 1: Backend infrastructure (entities, connections, basic CRUD)
2. Phase 2: Frontend components (explorer, editor, basic functionality)
3. Phase 3: Advanced features (versioning, diff, execution)
4. Phase 4: Integration testing and documentation

Rollback: Disable SQL Editor module, no impact on existing functionality

## Open Questions

- Should procedure execution be logged for audit purposes?
- Do we need procedure scheduling/automation capabilities?
- Should templates support parameter validation rules?
- Do we need procedure dependency tracking?
